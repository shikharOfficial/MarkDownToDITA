Then, we have a super<sup>script</sup> and a sub<sub>script</sub>. Now we see some red, green and blue text. Some text with a yellow highlight. Some text in a box. Some text in inverse video.</p><p>A paragraph with styled text: subtle emphasis  followed by <b>strong text </b>and intense emphasis. This paragraph uses document wide styles for styling rather than inline text properties as demonstrated in the previous paragraph â€” calibre can handle both with equal ease.</p></conbody></concept>
