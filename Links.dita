Both are supported by calibre. For example, here is a link pointing to the <xref href="http://calibre-ebook.com/download" scope="external" format="html">calibre download page</xref>. Then we have a link that points back to the section on <xref href="#_Paragraph_level_formatting">paragraph level formatting</xref> in this document.</p></body></topic>
